Docker
========
Application Development
|-Collection of program is called software project

|-Software project contains several components
	1)Front end components
	2)Backend comonents
	3)Database Components


|-In order to deploy our application in a machine we need to setup all the softwares which are required to our   application.
  EX: OS, java 1.8v,mysql,tomcat etc.

|-In Realtime project should be deployed into multiple environments for testing purpose.
	Ex: DEV,SIT,UAT,PILOT and PROD

|-DEV env will be used by Devlopers to peform integration testing
|-SIT env will be used by Testing team to test functionality of the application
|-UAT env will be used by client to test functionality of the application
|-PILOT env means pre-prodction testing env
|-PROD meand live environment

|-To deploy application to these many environments we need to take of all the softwars required to run our  application in all environment. It is very difficult task.



Virtualization
==============
|-Installing Multiple Guest Operating systems in one Host Operating System.
|-Hypervisior S/W will be used to achieve this
|-We need to install all the required software in HOST OS to run our application
|-It is old technique to run the applications
|-System performance will become slow in this process
|-To overcome the problems of virutalization we are going for Containerization Concept.

Containerization
===================
|-It is used to package all the softwares and application code in one container for execution.

|-Container will take care of everything which is required to run our application

|-We can run the containers in Mutilple machines easily.

|-Docker is a containerization software.

|-Using Docker S/W we will create container for our application.


Notes:
==========
|-Docker is a containerization software
|-Docker will take care of application and application dependencies for execution
|-Deployments into multiple environments will become easy if we use Docker containers concept.
Docker Architecture
======================
|-Docker is a platform for packaging ,deploying and running applications

|-Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software  quickly.

|-Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to  run including libraries,system tools,code and runtime.


|-By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping,testing and deploying code quickly


Docker Architecture
====================
              Build                 Run
Docker File==========>Docker image========>Docker Container



Docker Terminology
====================
1)Dockerfile
2)Docker Image
3)Docker Container
4)Docker Registry
5)Docker Engine


1)Dockerfile:
 |-Dockerfile contains instructions to create an image.
 |-It contains Docker Domain Specific keywords to build image.


2)Docker Image:
 |-Docker imange is a package which contains everything(App code+softwares+env+libraries)

3)Docker Container
 |-Docker Container is run time instance of Docker Image out application will execute in Docker container.

4)Docker Registry
 |-Docker Registry is a place where we can store our Docker images.
 |-Docker Hub is a public registry. Everybody can store and retrieve images
 |-AWS ECR

5)Docker Engine
 |-Docker Engine is a software using which we will create Docker images and Docker Container
