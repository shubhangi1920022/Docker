	Dockerfile
################################
|-Dockerfile contains instructions to build docker image
|-In Dockerfile we will use DSL(Domain Specific Language)keywords

|-Docker engine will process Dockerfile instructions from top to bottom

|-Dockerfile keywords are listed below
FROM
MAINTAINER
COPY
ADD
RUN
CMD
ENTRYPOINT
ENV
LABEL
USER
WORKDIR
EXPOSE
VOLUME


FROM:It indicates base image to run our application. On top of base image we will create our image.
  Syntax:
	FROM <IMAGE_NAME>
Example:
	FROM java:1.8.0
	FROM tomcat:9.2
	FROM mysql


MAINTAINER:It represent who is author

EX: MAINTAINER JOHN <john@gmail.com>


COPY: 
|-It is used to copy files/folders to image while creating image
|-copy command is used to copy files/folder from location to other location while create the image

Syntax:
	COPY <source> <destination>


Examle:
	#copying war file from target directory to tomcat/webapps directory
	COPY target/maven-web-app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapp/maven-web-app.war

ADD:
|-ADD is also used to copy files to image while creating an image
|-ADD keyword can download files from remote location(http)
|-ADD keyword will extract tar file while copying to image

Notes:
 |-zip files we have to extract manually
Syntax:
	ADD <source> <destination>
	ADD <url-to-download> <destination>


Q)What is difference between COPY and ADD?


RUN:
 |-It is used to execute commands on top of base image
 |-Rum command instructions will execute while creating an image

Example:
	RUN mkdir workspace
        RUN  yum install git


CMD:
 |-CMD is also used to execute commands
 |-CMD instructions will execute while creating a container.
	
Example:
	CMD sudo start tomcat

|-We can write multiple CMD instructions in Dockerfile but Docker will process only last CMD instructions.



|-Create docker file

FROM ubuntu
RUN echo "Run One Updated"
RUN echo "RUN TWO"
CMD echo "Echo from Image"
CMD echo "Echo from Latest"
RUN echo "RUN Three"
